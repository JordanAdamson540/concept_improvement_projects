The goal of this repository is to create programs that help me understand certain concepts. Some projects are random, others much more beneficial. I will try to list each 
project out and give a brief description here

1. mod_remainder_divmod : a program that gives you different practice problems of one of the three division operators that deal with remainders. The point of the project was 
to practice the computation of what to do when negatives appear, as well as when the |a| < |b| (ex: a < b).

2. while_until_loop_return_value (idea) : for whatever reason, I have trouble with until loops. Not the concept itself, but figuring out where the loop stops execution (which 
is sad because I have a math background). The point of the project is to generate either while or until loops with different code combinations that force me to guess what the 
return value is.
